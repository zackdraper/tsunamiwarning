# Tsunami Warning

An app desigend to relay information fron the National Tsunami Warning Center.  A while back I was on my boat and under an evacuation from a Tsunami Warning, but didn't get woken by police until 4:00 AM, when the warning went out at 1:30 AM.  So having an alarm to wake me up and notify me, can give me extra time.

NTWC at https://tsunami.gov/ for all the latest information and data products.  They have Twitter, ATOM, and thier website to relay warnings if an earthquake occurs and has potential for a Tsunami.
